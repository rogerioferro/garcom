  <!-- dojo.js is an AMD-compliant loader script. It accepts configuration either from a data-dojo-config attribute,
       as shown here, from a global dojoConfig object (which must be defined *before* dojo.js is loaded), or from
       a global require object.

       Configuration options for the loader can be viewed at http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/loader/amd.html
       along with a bunch of additional information about its features.

       Below, we’re doing the following:

       1. Enabling the AMD loader. (async: 1)
       2. Fixing the loader to use normal AMD resolution of unregistered module paths (relative to baseDir)
          instead of the traditional Dojo resolution method (relative to the parent of baseDir).
          (tlmSiblingOfDojo: 0)
       3. Enabling debugging. (isDebug: 1)

       The remainder of Dojo configuration, as well as our application’s instantiation, occurs within
       app/run.js.

   NOTE: `build.sh` is responsible for removing the "isDebug" flag when deploying to production. If you modify
   this flag at all, you will break the build! -->
  <script data-dojo-config="tlmSiblingOfDojo: 0, isDebug: 1" src="dojo/dojo.js"></script>


  <!-- Load the loader configuration script. Note that this module ID is hard-coded in build.sh in order to provide
       an optimised build that loads as few as one script for the entire application. If you change the name or
       location of this module, you will need to update build.sh too. -->
  <script src="app/run.js"></script>

  <!-- include cordova script. -->
